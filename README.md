**#1. Install a VPN**

VPN services are a must when you’re attempting to access the dark web. Why? Because of the long arm of the law, of course. Technically, you are free to surf on this Internet layer, provided that you don’t engage in any illegal activities. However, a recent ruling by the US Supreme Court deemed that even casually browsing the darknet can get you in a lot of hot water.

This means that if the authorities would intercept your darknet connection request, they would have had enough reason to search your house and confiscate the machine used for browsing. So, do yourself a favor and download a VPN before messing about on the dark web. Need a hand picking one? Check out this article written by one of my colleagues to narrow down your search.

**#2. Install an Adequate Browser**

**The first rule of the dark web – never**, ever use your default browser to search for stuff on the darknet. Popular browsers like Chrome, Opera, or Firefox have tracking technologies that make you very visible on the authorities’ radar. So, if you’re still willing to do this, I would recommend you download Tor, which is, by far, the safest and easy-to-use onion browser.

Of course, there are others who would argue that Tor being made by the military for covert communication makes it unreliable, privacy-wise since it’s believed to be watched. I wouldn’t take that one for granted, but, then again, there’s no smoke without fire. It’s all up to you.

OF TOR, VPNS AND OTHER DEMONS

Anyway, going back to Tor – why use this particular browser over a regular one? Well, that’s a rather long story, but worth telling, nonetheless. As you know, a regular browser mediates between the user’s search request and the site about to be accessed. Normally, your query will go through the ISP’s DNS, which in turn consults other resources to help you get the answer you were looking for.

Now, with Tor, the search request kind of bounces around multiple Tor relays before completing your search request. You’re probably wondering about what the heck are Tor relays. Well, what we call the clear web is, in fact, a conglomerate of servers, which are managed either by companies or on volunteer-basis.

The same principle applies more or less to what we call the dark web. Since it’s the dark side of the Internet we’re dealing with here, secrecy and untraceability become inherent. Thus, the info’s stored on Tor relays which are managed by volunteers.

**So, what happens when you want to access a dark web onion?**

First of all, if you followed my advice and installed a VPN, the tunneling signal will be encrypted. This means that your ISP won’t have a clue about what you’re about to search for. Sure, it can still see that you want to access a Tor node, but other than it’s blinder than a mole.

From there, it will be redirected to another node and then another one. Why does it do that? For anonymity reasons, of course; ‘no breadcrumbs’ means that there’s no way for someone to trace the signal back to you.

**VPN ONLY? UNLIKELY.**

Congrats! You just took the first steps of your dark web journey. Still, there are a couple of more precautions you must take before you can pop open Pandora’s box of dark Internet wonders. Getting back to Tor and VPN.  There’s no broad consensus on dark web safety.

However, everyone tends to agree that using only Tor is not enough. The two of them (Tor and VPN) work in tandem and, as it happens, there are several ways of tunneling your way all the way through the dark web using this dynamic duo. Here’s what you need to know.

**METHOD I – TOR OVER VPN**

Sounds very techie, doesn’t it? Well, it’s really not that complicated – using the Tor over VPN method means connecting to a VPN service before using the Tor browser. Have to say that this is the most popular and safest method to access onion links, and, on my part, a marriage made in Heaven: Tor’s an excellent ‘anonymizer’, while VPN safeguards your privacy.

When using this method, Tor will encrypt your request, which will pass through your ISP unhindered. From there, it will go through a VPN server that conceals your IP and wipes geo-locations tags and other elements your Government or ISP might use to track the request.

**Next step** – your request will be transferred to Tor entry nod which in turn transfers to one or more Tor relays. From there, it gets slingshot to several Tor exit nodes. Afterwards, your request will be matched with the appropriate website. Tricky, but effective; that’s why it’s, by far, the best method to access dark web content.

**METHOD II – VPN OVER TOR**

_Not very safe, but it’s still useable._ Recall how Tor oven VPN works? Well, VPN over Tor is basically its opposite – instead of going through the VPN first, the signal passes through the Tor network, before going through the VPN. Why is this method so unpopular? Because it’s not as safe as Tor over VPN.

If the signal goes through the Tor network first, your ISP will be able to see that you are attempting to connect to a Tor node. Though no one should bat an eye just because you’re attempting to access the dark web, keep in mind that in some countries, like the United States, even a simple foray can get you in trouble.

**PRO(S) OF USING VPN OVER TOR:**

• Great if you trust your ISP, but not the VPN provider.

• Can bypass blocked Tor nodes.

CON(S):

• ISP can see you trying to access onion content.

• Susceptible to end-to-end timing attacks.

Now, if you want to see what lurks in the dark corners of the Internet but don’t really trust Tor, there are alternatives.

_**HERE IS A COUPLE OF THEM:**_

1. I2P – great privacy protection and can access hidden onion links.

2. Matrix.org – an open-source project just like Tor. Great for IoT data transfers, chats, and WebRTC signaling.

3. Orbot – basically a Tor for Android.

4. Globus Secure Browser – paid Tor alternative. VPN-powered. It allows the users to select preferredgeolocation. If you want to take it for a spin, Globus features a five-day trial period.

5. Comodo Ice Dragon – Firefox offspin. Employs multiple malware safeguards. Open-source project.

6. FreeNet – open-source project. Sports the Darknet and OpenNet anonymous browsing technologies.
